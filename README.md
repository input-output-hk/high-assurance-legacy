Overview
========

This is the old repository of the project to develop implementations of
blockchain consensus protocols from the Ouroboros family in a process
calculus and verify that they have various key properties.

In this final, archived form, this repository contains only some old
exploratory material as well as code we have chosen not to develop
further, in most cases because it got superseded by superior
components. We keep this repository around merely for people interested
in the history of this project.

The actively developed code of this project can be found in the
following GitHub repositories:

  * [equivalence-reasoner](https://github.com/input-output-hk/equivalence-reasoner)
