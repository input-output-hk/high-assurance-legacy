        We need \<^theory_text>\<open>comp_def\<close> and perhaps \<^theory_text>\<open>id_def\<close>, because @{command lift_definition} creates facts
        involving \<^term>\<open>(\<circ>)\<close> and \<^const>\<open>id\<close>.

      Document why simplification has to be done in two steps: in the case of \<open>\<Prod>\<close>, for example, we
      need to be sure that \<open>\<Prod>\<close> is turned into its lifted variant and not expanded.
