Commit rules
============

When committing to the Git repository, please follow these rules:

  * Put only related changes into a single commit.

  * Use Markdown for the entire commit message (subject line and body).

  * Separate the subject line from the body with a blank line.

  * Limit the subject line to 50 characters.

  * Start the subject with a capital letter.

  * Do not end the subject line with a period.

  * Use the imperative mood in the subject line.

  * Wrap the body at 72 characters.

  * Use the body to explain the *what* and *why*, not the *how*.

Several of these rules have been taken from
